Revision history for Perl extension VMS::Queue

0.01  Mon Dec 01 13:32:04 1997
	- Copied over from VMS::Process.
    - Implemented the xxx_list, xxx_info, and xxx_properties routines.
      xxx_list doesn't take a property hash yet, though.

0.02  Wed Dec 10 09:22:05 1997
    - Fixed basic.t. (Was VMS::Process' tests--chopped out everything but
      test 1)
    - Added xxx_bitmap_decode functions.
    - Took quicktest.pl out of MANIFEST. MakeMaker'll whine on a distclean,
      but at least quicktest.pl won't get installed now.

0.03  Mon Dec 15 12:34:12 1997
    - Added delete_entry, delete_queue, delete_form, delete_manager, and
      delete_characteristic functions
    - modified the xxx_properties function. The value for each key is now a
      hash, with four keys, INPUT_INFO, OUTPUT_INFO, INPUT_ACTION, and
      OUTPUT_ACTION. The values for these keys will be true or false,
      depending on whether the property is an input or output property for
      the action or info functions. A property can be multiple things.
    - Added stop_queue, start_queue, reset_queue, and pause_queue
      functions.
    - Added start_manager and stop_manager functions.
    - Added hold_entry and release_entry functions.
